        <p>Hi there, I'm Lawrence! ðŸ™‚ </p>
        <p>
          I currently work as a software engineer at Jump Trading, focusing on
          web and UI development. I love coding and building things,
          particularly when the end result puts a smile on someone's face or has
          a positive social impact! In my spare time I love reading, cooking,
          travelling and playing piano, and I also enjoy chatting and learning
          about history and astronomy. A slightly eclectic mix of interests, I
          know!
        </p>

          my <Link to="/blog">blog</Link>, where I discuss and share things I'm
          passionate about - particularly the hobbies I don't get to explore in
          my day job. Feel free to get in touch by{" "}
